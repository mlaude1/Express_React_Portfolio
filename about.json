  "bio": "I graduated from Cairn University in 2019 with a degree in Music Education. I went on to work at a private school where I was the K-12 Music Teacher. In the wake of COVID-19, my school ended up having to shut down. Afterwards, I decided to become a software engineer, attend General Assembly, and graduated in 2021."
